# ðŸš€ Quantum_Learning_Path_with QuCode
Tracking my journey through Quantum Computing with <a href="https://qucode.in/" target="_blank">QuCode</a> . This repo documents my progress, notes, code snippets, and resources as I explore the fascinating world of quantum algorithms, circuits, and applications.

## Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics for computation.
- Learn how to use **Qiskit** for building and simulating quantum circuits.
- Explore quantum algorithms such as Groverâ€™s and Shorâ€™s.
- Apply quantum computing concepts to problem-solving and projects.
- Build a public portfolio of my learning progress.
